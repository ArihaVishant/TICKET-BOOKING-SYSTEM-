# TICKET-BOOKING-SYSTEM-
The basic role of making the online cinema ticket booking system is to make a programmed online-based system which will provide a simple and exchange approach to book a ticket for a film. The client should enter the data identified with the film after which the system will provide choices to book the ticket. 
In this python project, we made an online movie ticket booking system. We used various functions and function calls, conditional statements such as- if else statements and nested if. With the help of all these functions and conditional statements we are able to get an input from the user and are able to run the program and get the output which lets us book a ticket.
